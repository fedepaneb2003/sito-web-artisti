                    Berlin-based illustrator Martina Paukova likes to dabble in the colorful
                    nuances of everyday moments. “My work consists of daily mundane scenes 
                    and lanky characters, often with perplexed expressions and dated hairdos, 
                    sitting behind computers or sipping coffee,” she says. “I like to explore 
                    and mold the everyday, the awkward, and the bendy.” Martina’s work has rocketed 
                    in popularity in the last couple of years, seeing her create humorous, jam-packed 
                    images in a trademark palette with Memphis-inspired patterns for an increasingly 
                    impressive list of clients. Previously, Martina studied politics in Slovakia before 
                    changing direction to study illustration at Camberwell College of Arts in London. 
                    She now spends her days on various editorial and commercial commissions, injecting 
                    personality into an image in a way that is uniquely her own. Like a modern-day MC 
                    Escher, her colorful, quirky perspectives move and change, with each element slotting 
                    together like a well-crafted puzzle.
